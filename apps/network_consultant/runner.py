network_consultant -- same iterative test-and-fix loop as apps/network_improver, except the
fix step calls the specialized agent_network_consultant network instead of
agent_network_designer in modify mode. agent_network_designer is a general create/modify
tool that has to first figure out "is this structural or instructions-only"; consultant_editor
skips that and goes straight from a failing-test report to per-agent instruction fixes.

By default this runs in-process (--connection direct), no server needed. Pass --connection
http to instead talk to an already-running `ns run` server -- useful if you want this to share
a server with other clients, but NOT to watch the run in nsflow: nsflow's live view only shows
conversations started through its own UI/websocket, so a script hitting the neuro-san server's
plain chat API directly (this one) never appears there regardless of connection type.

Usage:
    python -m apps.network_consultant.runner --use-case "A coffee shop order-status bot"
    python -m apps.network_consultant.runner --hocon-file generated/coffee_shop.hocon \
        --direction "Preserve order lookup"
    python -m apps.network_consultant.runner --hocon-file generated/coffee_shop.hocon \
        --direction "Preserve order lookup" --connection http
